Unit Testing: software development technique for ensuring that individulas units of code work as expected. 
unit testing is usually performed with methods and functions. 

It's developers job to perform unit testing. 


Database ---> Repository ---> Service ---> Controller

Good cases: 
Edge cases: 
Known exception: 
Unknown exception: 

For testing: 
1. Unit testing Framework. Example: MS Test, NUnit, XUnit 
2. Mocking Framework      Example: Moq -->(most popular), FakeItEasy, NSubstitute

CategoryUnitTestClass ----> GetAllCategoriesAsync() ---> CategoryRepositoryClass ---> GetAllAsync() ---->Database with EF

Unit testing should be very fast and they should never depend on external dependencies like database.
